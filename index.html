        <h2>- College Teacher</h2>
        <p>
          Hey! I started my career in 2015. Since then, 
          A college teacher typically holds an advanced degree (often a Master's or PhD) in their field of expertise and is responsible for delivering lectures, conducting seminars, and guiding students in their academic pursuits. Their primary role is to impart knowledge and foster critical thinking among students within their subject area. College teachers often engage in research, publish academic papers, and contribute to their field's body of knowledge.
